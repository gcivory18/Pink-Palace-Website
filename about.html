<h2 id="second-header">Who We Are</h2>
<p id="large-paragraph"> Pink Palace started making music in an unfinished basement in the suburbs of Boston in 2018. The band was formed by Jon, Hallie, and Kaitlyn, who have been friends all their lives. Their friendship was based on creativity; as kids, they made comics, videos, and card games, eventually, their love of music brought them all together to create Pink Palace. It originally started as a way to deal with emotions and explore their identities and has evolved to be a combination of their different styles and perspectives.
    They combine their favorite pieces of media, including Coraline and Bojack Horseman, to create music that reflects the themes of these shows, both lyrical and aesthetically. They named themselves after the apartment complex in the movie Coraline and have been drawing inspiration from it ever since.</p>
